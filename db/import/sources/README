Overview
--------
These are some rough data import scripts for the 'Spending Money' change.org
2012 project.

The data sourced is from the SF City Controller's office, as made public by
datasf.org

To run a fresh import over the data, run the following command from the
'sources' directory:

# cat Adopted_Budgets_for_two_years_ending_FY_2011-12.csv | psql -f extract.sql


This should produce 3 concatenated CSV listings to stdout, which are, in turn:

* A numbered list of all departments mentioned in the report
* A numbered list of all programs (attached to departments) from the report
* Expenditure for each of the programs over the two years included


These are currently written out into separate .csv files in this directory for
ease of loading.


Caveats/Unknowns
--------
Only line items with a type of 'Gross Expenditure', 'Facilities Maintenance',
and 'Capital Projects' have been included; this seems to tally with other
initial checks against SF city spending, but would be good to validate


Manual Data Collection
--------
Department descriptions were gathered manually, starting with the most highly
funded departments in the dataset.

Departments have manually been assigned to overarching 'functions' so that
they may be grouped for viewing at a higher level.
